6. Take entry of 5 marks from user out of 100. Take attendance % of all subjects
    * If `avg_attendance` % is GT 75 calculate grade according to rule mentioned below
        * if `avg_marks` are between 40 to 60 C grade
        * `avg_marks` between 61 to 80 B grade
        * `avg_marks` between 81 to 100 A grade
        * Below 40 is F grade.
    * if attendance is less than 75% print you can't give exam
    ```
    Sample Input
    Input: 61,62,63,64,65.
