## Lab 8: 2-D Array
1. Multiplication of two matrices.
2. Compute the row sum and column sum of a given matrix.
3. Check if the given matrix is magic square or not.
4. Find whether a given matrix is symmetric or not. Hint: `A = A^T`
5. Find the trace and norm of a given square matrix.
    * Trace = sum of principal diagonal elements
    * Norm = sort (sum of squares of the individual elements of an array)
6. Searching for an element in the matrix and counting the number of its occurrences.
